# sightwordsrock

Introduction

Sight Words Rock is a web application 
where students can play games to learn
non-phonetic words - words that are
pronounced differently than spelled.

The goal of our project is for children to 
be able to recognize sight words without 
having to decode them.

Research

It is proven in a study by Jaclyn Dynia that young
children on average have low efficiency
recognizing sight words quickly.

The Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) is a 
measure of an individualâ€™s ability to pronounce 
printed words (Sight Word Efficiency).

The scaled scores for the TOWRE Sight Words are 
as follows: 131 or higher is Very Superior, 121-130 is 
Superior, 111-120 is Above Average, 90-110 is 
Average, 80-89 is Below Average, 70-79 is Poor, 
and 69 and below is Very Poor. 90 second and 
third grade students scored an overall average of 
62.18.
